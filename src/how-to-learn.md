Techniques to learn stuff that is taught at universities
like mathematics, engineering or medicine, even if you are not at an university.

#why learn this stuff

- beautiful: some stuff is beatiful to learn

- useful: for society, and for yourself (if you help others you feel well and get money to survive).

- will help you decide your future job. Trying it out is the only way to learn.

#english

If you don't know English, you cannot make any real developments on any knowledge domain.

Learn English before you do anything else.

#what to learn?

The first thing is to decide what you should learn.

Best method: look at course lists for top universities.
Try to follow it in the same order as the people in that course.

If things stop making sense, at some point,
look up courses for high school for the bases.

Subjective but good enough for our purposes.

#how to learn

##find the sources

Once you have decided the subject, find all the best sources like books or tutorials on the subject.

There are more and more free materials online.
Search for them and try them out. Their quality realy depends on the subject area.
For certain subjecs you really need non-free books.
Sometimes there are small tutorials which clarify points that most books don't.

How to find the best books:

- see the bibliography for university courses. Go into the websiets for each course.

- put the subject name on [amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) and see the top books.

- [google](https://google.com) `SUBJECT best books`, or `SUBJECT best tutorials` or `SUBJECT best free books`.

##get the sources

- buy it new

- buy it used, even if an older version

- go to a library

A good method to search by ISBN.
The ISBN is a unique identifier of a book in 10 charcters.
You can find ISBNs on amazon.
For example for [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-James-Stewart/dp/0538497815) the isbn can be found at `ISBN-10: 0538497815`.
This way you can compare prices across many sites for the exact same book.

Please do *not* download material illegally via methods like:

- torrent
- upload sites. Most of those have links coming from irresponsible blogs

since this bankrupts publishing companies, and inhibits the creation of new books.

##use the sources

First look quickly at all of the sources one by one to find which one seems more interesting,
then go for it.

Start with sources that are

- simple
- concrete with lots of examples
- motivational

and *not* too theorethical.

If things stop making sense, try for 5 more minutes, and then jump:

- forwards
- backwards
- to another book

If you could not understand something, it is because there is someting else missing, possible from another source.
Don't wast too much time stuck on a single point: when you less expect you will find the answer.

Whenever you learn something, specially if it was difficult to learn, *write it down* somewhere you will find it again.
Even better: write it down on your computer and publish it online to help others.
Many methods are available such as blogs, but the best is writting in latex or markdown and uploading to github.
