Lists of subjects and good sources to learn sicence and technology topics.

Includes a suggestion of the learning order.

Mainly intented for high school or lower students who want to learn fun and useful stuff for real.

This is inspired by <http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/theorist.html>, which is for physics by Nobel Prize Hooft.

#prerequisites

Read [this](https://github.com/cirosantilli/text/blob/1.0/src/how-to-learn.md).

#subjects by order

This section lists subjects more or less in the same order as you should learn them.

Each subsection should be learnt at the same time.

##1

- the [C programming language](#c-programming-language)
- [latex](#latex)
- [calculus](#calculus) single variable up to integration and ODEs.

##2

- all of calculus: multivariable, power series, PDEs, Fourrier transforms,
- all of linear algebra
- computer algorithms and data structures
- numerical methods to solve linear algebra and calculus problems
- physics: mechanics and eletromagnetism.

##3

- physics: quantum, special relativity and statistical physics.
- chemistry

#subjects

This section lists subjects and knowldge areas such as mathematics or chemistry.

It contains a description of why each subject is cool,
and links to good sources to learn those subjects.

Within each section, the most basic subjects are listed first.
The hardest subject of an area may have to be learnt before the first subject of another area.

Sources are listed in the order which you should read them.

##latex

Best way to make professional texts on your computer, to then transform them in pdfs.

Learn it and write *everything* you learn with it.

Reasons why it is better than Microsoft word `.docx` or Libreoffice `.doc`:

- better for formulas
- better for cross references (ex: in formula 1 we said that...)
- text format, meaning you can read it byte by byte.
    This will be very important when you will start using source control.
    Don't worry if you don't understand what this is for now.

Sources: lots of free tutorials online, just google for it.

####next steps

- a source code control sytem such as Git.

- markdown, specially pandoc markdown. It may replace latex in the future, as it is easier to read and write.

##proramming

Programming is fun, useful and costless if you have a computer at hand.

Almost all technological applications have a theoretical basis,
but use computers for part of the imlementation.

###C programming language

Very important programmin language because it is used to write fundamental programs such as:

- the Linux kernel
- the Windows kernel
- programs that run other languages such as python

And many many other very important programs.

Can produce very fast programs.

Great fun to apply more theorical things you are learning.

Sources: many free tutorials on the web, just google for them.

####next steps

- other languages such as C++ or Java or python
- assembler, which is the basis for C

###C++ programming language

###assembler programming

###Java programming language

###Python programming language

###algorithms and data structures.

Learn big O complexity. This is how algorithms are compared for which is better than which. Requires calculus.

##mathematics

To do science and technology we need to predict and control the future.
To do that we need formulas that say: if you do A, you get B.
Those formulas are written down in mathematics.

###calculus

Basis of all physics and applieds mathematics. *Extermelly imporant*.

Free sources: this is one of the subjects with the largest ammounts of free material online,
due to is absolute importance. Just google for them.

Non free sources:

- [Stewart](http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-James-Stewart/dp/0538497815)

###linear algebra

Basis for:

- most numerical methods
- part of quantum mechanics
- modeling certain industrial problems via linear programming

###probability and statistics

##physics

We want to control the future. Physics allows us to predict if we do X, what happens then.

Learn:

- basic mechanics
- electromagnetism
- quantum
- statistical
- relativity. General relativity is not yet very useful for applications, but lots of fun!

##chemistry

Requires: physics.

Most technological advances are either backed up or made possible because of chemical / materials techniques.
For example, computer chips need precise compositions and combination condition of certain elements to work.

##biology

Requires: chemistry.

Medicine is simply a type of engineering, except that intead of modelling a car you model a body or cell.
